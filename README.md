# Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor - Hardware Modification 5V to 3V


## Description
This project describes how to modify specific versions of the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor that come without a voltage regulator and use a NE555 timer instead of a TCL555. The modification involves replacing the resistor R4 with a 91K Ohm resistor to achieve a 3V analog output signal.

## Modification Instructions

1. **Materials:**
   - Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor (with NE555 without XC6206P302) 
   - 91K Ohm resistor
   - A fine soldering iron and a steady hand
     
2. **Modification Steps:**
   - Remove the existing resistor and replace it with the 91K Ohm resistor.
 

3. **Expected Outcome:**
   - After modification, the sensor should output a 3V analog signal.
## Before and After
Here are some images demonstrating the modification process:

## Notes
- Take care during the modification process to avoid damaging the pcb.
- It is recommended to conduct tests to verify functionality after the modification, including measuring the output signal to ensure it is providing the expected 3V analog output.
